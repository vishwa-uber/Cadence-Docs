    "body": "# We are v1.0!\r\n\r\n## What does this mean?!\r\n\r\nAt the moment, not much.  This is largely to mirror [the v1.0 release in the server](https://github.com/uber/cadence/releases/tag/v1.0.0).\r\n\r\nImportantly, v1.0 _does not_ imply any change to backwards compatibility - the current policy is still \"best effort with some obvious exceptions\" (like new methods on the service client interface).  \r\nGoing by previous version patterns, this would have been labeled v0.20.0 as it is a relatively incremental change off of v0.19.1.\r\n\r\n## Coming soon(ish): v2\r\n\r\n**We are planning on releasing a v2 of this client!**  There will likely be more v1 changes first though.\r\n\r\nv0 / v1 has been boxed in a bit by backwards compatibility requirements and a few leaky APIs (aliases, exposed thrift objects, etc).  This has been making some desired changes difficult or nigh-impossible.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, v2 is intended largely as a cleanup so we can make larger internal changes without interrupting our users.  We will be intentionally avoiding major semantic changes, and you will be able to _and encouraged to_ use v1 and v2 side by side to gradually migrate.  We'll be relying on this v1+v2 ability internally quite a bit, to migrate our monorepo :)\r\nWorkflow histories should remain backwards compatible, but code will require some simple and generally-obviously-correct changes, and previously-opt-in features may become opt-out or simply disappear in favor of the new behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen this occurs, it will essentially signal the end of feature development on v1.  We will likely make exceptions for IDL changes (largely due to the shared IDL repository, which protobuf effectively requires us to use) and easily-backport-able bugfixes, but this will end at some point.\r\nDue to this, you will definitely be _encouraged_ to migrate ASAP, so you can eliminate the v1 dependency.\r\n\r\nWe'll have migration details written up in detail when it's ready.\r\n\r\n#

More details can be seen in Yarpc's PR: https://github.com/yarpc/yarpc-go/pull/2075\r\nThis _partially_ corrects a number of version-related issues, e.g. #523 , #812 , #1107 , and part of #1129 .  Since Go modules cannot prevent an upgrade, they cannot be stopped entirely, but it should prevent them from occurring for users who do not already depend on a newer thrift.\r\n\r\nIf you encounter test failures due to logic in `defer` running where it did not previously: your tests likely depended on the bug fixed in #1117 .  The behavior now matches production more closely, so please update your tests.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least: Selector and Channel docs are now significantly more detailed.  Please consider reading them!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBugfixes and improvements:\r\n222e0cb Add DecisionTaskStartedEventID to workflowInfo (#1127)\r\n982628d Improve check for invalid pollForDecisionTaskResponse (#1122)\r\n332c2b4 Fix client side race condition (#1124)\r\nb2db20e Close the test dispatcher when completing (#1117)\r\n167c643 Use the same timer duration validation with server (#1121)\r\nb32ef3e Minor cleanup (#1106)\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n2e7438c Enhancing docs for selector and channel, from feedback and careful testing (#1137)\r\n8c34519 Filling out Selector docs, and some adjacent ones I noticed (#1131)\r\n2017e60 Add documentation for Selector (#1115)\r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nae45c0f Bump yarpc to 1.55.0 (#1110)"
