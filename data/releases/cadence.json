    "body": "## Project release: Zonal isolation \r\n\r\nThis version introduces a few resiliency concepts into customers' worker task processing such that they can detect deployment or configuration failures earlier. These features are opt-in.\r\n\r\nThe high-level concept is to provide a means to subdivide work (called 'isolation-groups') for workers along whatever partitioning mechanism that is required for your service. \r\n\r\nBy default the partitioning mechanism provided will attempt to keep workflows running in the location the are started, such that customers may identify broken changes earlier, rather than waiting for the deployment of an entire region. However, if there are no pollers available available in that subdivision, it'll route the work elsewhere.\r\n\r\n### Nomenclature\r\n\r\n**Partitioning**: A means to subdivide the tasks given to workflows, of which there are many possible schemes and one default one provided. When a workflow is started, a group of partition keys are provided by request headers. The partition keys are used to determine which isolation group of workers should process these workflows.\r\n**Workflow pinning**: A partitioning scheme which emphasizes keeping workflows running in the location they were started\r\n**Isolation-groups**: A division of work within a customer region in which they can subdivide their workers and pin the workflows. This originally was intended as a synonym for 'zone' in the site reliability, as a subdivision of a region. However the important point is that this is a failure domain for customer workflows, so this may be an arbitrary subdivision of your cluster's traffic.\r\n**Isolation-group drain**: A means of excluding work from an isolation-group. If an isolation group is drained, workers from that isolation group won't be able to get any task. And customers cannot start workflows from that isolation group.\r\n\r\n### Default concepts and approaches\r\n\r\nThe partitioning and isolation concepts are intended to be provided as general purpose orchestration concepts and flexible, with some basic defaults provided. By default the following behaviour is given:\r\n\r\n- Partition data is persisted with workflow execution records by the [provided middleware](https://github.com/uber/cadence/blob/45ca74f45e1fcf4a9103dcd8d5cb312b0611d3e1/common/rpc/middleware.go#L231-L232) if the [provided header](https://github.com/uber/cadence/blob/45ca74f45e1fcf4a9103dcd8d5cb312b0611d3e1/common/rpc.go#L60-L61) is passed when workflows are created.\r\n- The cadence client and worker Go libraries will pass these as headers if provided in [client options](https://github.com/uber-go/cadence-client/blob/4dd2716c89bd00c7feebc6891668159650517073/internal/worker.go#L132)\r\n\r\n#### Pinning behaviour\r\n\r\nThe workflow original zone is captured on workflow start and will be used on workflow processing. \r\n\r\nThe default partitioner provides the following behaviour: [It will attempt to dispatch work](https://github.com/uber/cadence/blob/45ca74f45e1fcf4a9103dcd8d5cb312b0611d3e1/common/partition/default-partitioner.go#L112) in a zone where the workflow was started. However, workers may not be available in that zone, or no longer available for some reason. So the partitioner takes information from a lookback of poller information and uses this lookback data to ensure that the workflow can be processed. If the the start isolation-group is not available it'll another healthy random one. \r\n\r\n'Health', here, is determined as the presence of pollers and the absence of drains.\r\n\r\nThe 'unpinning' is import for two main reasons: firstly, it's quite possible to start a workflow from an unrelated isolation-group in which the pollers are created and to suddenly blackhole that work would likely be not the desired behaviour. But secondly, and probably more importantly, this prevents a head-of-line blocking problem internally for Cadence. At the database level (in this release anyway) tasks need to be dispatched in-order and so if an isolation-group were to be not processed it would block task processing.\r\n\r\n#### Drains\r\n\r\nThis release also introduces a simplistic notion of drains, which allow for isolation-groups to be excluded from traffic processing, should that be required. Drains are issuable via the Admin API or via cli:\r\n\r\neg: \r\n\r\n`cadence admin isolation-groups update-global --set-drains zone-1`\r\n`cadence admin isolation-groups get-global`\r\n\r\nThis information is stored in the config-store and is not part of dynamic configuration.\r\n\r\n#### Configuration\r\n\r\nIn order to use this feature, the requisite configuration is required:\r\n\r\n`system.allIsolationGroups`: This is a list of all the possible isolation-groups\r\n`system.enableTasklistIsolation`: This is the bool flag to enable it for a domain\r\n\r\n#### Implementation\r\n\r\nThe changes for this feature are largely in Matching and can be (reductively) described as: Sync and Async-match in Cadence as being made aware of a new dimension; their associated isolation-group. The tasks piped through the Matching service are matching the appropriate isolation-group channel. \r\n\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Set config for shardscanner fixer by @mantas-sidlauskas in

    "body": "# We are v1.0!  (with a schema upgrade)\r\n\r\n## What does this mean?!\r\n\r\nNot much.  Primarily that we are declaring \"it's stable and in use\" more visibly, because we continually get questions about this :)  A larger public announcement / state-of-the-project is in the works.\r\n\r\nImportantly, v1.0 _does not_ imply any change to backwards compatibility (the minimum supported client version has not changed), RPC compatibility (ditto, all changes are backwards compatible), or Go API compatibility (this is not truly a library, Go compatibility is not a goal).\r\n\r\nGoing by previous version patterns, this would have been labeled v0.26.0 as it is a relatively incremental change (plus schema changes) from v0.25.0.  As such, some strings still reference \"0.26\", because this older SHA is the one we have been using the most internally.  \r\nThese strings will be updated and validated soon, and will likely be released as v1.0.1.  This should have no behavioral impact at all, but will be visible in metrics, logs, and display strings.\r\n\r\n## What do I need to do to upgrade?\r\n\r\n### Schema upgrades needed\r\nThere have been schema changes to both normal and visibility datastores, primarily to provide better data for cleanup and hot-shard detection:\r\n* Update-time additions by @neil-xie in https://github.com/uber/cadence/pull/4962 and https://github.com/uber/cadence/pull/4971\r\n* Add FirstExecutionRunID to mutable state by @Shaddoll in https://github.com/uber/cadence/pull/5031\r\n* Shard ID visibility additions by @allenchen2244 in https://github.com/uber/cadence/pull/5099 and https://github.com/uber/cadence/pull/5123\r\n\r\nThese were intentionally kept out of v0.25.0 to keep that upgrade simple, as they were not fully utilized yet.\r\n\r\n### Replication cache recommendation\r\nWe have internally disabled the replication cache (`history.replicatorCacheCapacity` dynamic config set to `0`), due to unexpectedly large memory use under abnormal load, and you may wish to do so as well.\r\n\r\nWe did not encounter any misbehavior, and it did reduce database load as intended, but we intend to make some changes to it to estimate and constrain memory use before re-enabling.\r\n\r\n## What has changed?\r\n\r\nAt a very high level, we've been focused on:\r\n* Internal scaling challenges, both improving bottlenecks and improving our ability to accurately identify bottlenecks\r\n  * Many metrics, logs, and refactors are at least somewhat related to this\r\n  * Our multi-cluster support is improved in particular, as we have been connecting clusters and moving many domains to spread load more evenly\r\n* Database corruptions, as our Cassandra clusters have had some problems that cause issues for months\r\n  * Many logs, scanner, and stale-task changes are related to this, e.g. to detect and remove invalid data\r\n* Scaling up the team\r\n  * More changes to come!\r\n\r\nSome loosely categorized PRs that were included follows:\r\n\r\n### Critical bugfixes (resolving issues in v0.25.0)\r\n* Fix ndc flush buffered events by @Shaddoll in https://github.com/uber/cadence/pull/5009\r\n* Hotfix a replication panic causing crashes by @davidporter-id-au in https://github.com/uber/cadence/pull/5074\r\n* Resolve an infinite loop around impossible cron schedules by @Groxx in https://github.com/uber/cadence/pull/5097\r\n\r\n### Parent-close-policies apply to child workflows even after they reset/continue-as-new/etc\r\n* Update parent close policy to terminate/cancel child workflows even after continue as new by @Shaddoll in https://github.com/uber/cadence/pull/5032\r\n  * This requires new stored data, so it does not apply to child workflows started before this version.\r\n\r\n### Better config introspection\r\n* Config store CLI: make value required when updating by @mantas-sidlauskas in https://github.com/uber/cadence/pull/5089\r\n* CLI: print all available dynamic config keys by @mantas-sidlauskas in https://github.com/uber/cadence/pull/5090\r\n\r\n### Schemas are now available via
